# can We use multiple h1 tag in page?
Yes, you can use multiple <h1> tags in HTML, but it is generally considered a best practice to have only one <h1> tag per page. The <h1> tag is used to define the main heading of a page and should describe the content of the entire page. Using multiple <h1> tags can make it harder for search engines and screen readers to understand the structure of your page . However, with the introduction of HTML5, using multiple <h1> tags within different sections of a page is now accepted as semantically correct.
